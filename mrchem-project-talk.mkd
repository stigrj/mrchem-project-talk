Improvements:
- Optimize MRCPP (sequential style)
- Parallelize MRChem
- Reach out to the chemistry application community
- Not that interested in high accuracy (why would they?)
- Data locality vs data distribution

Features:
- Re-introduce linear response code
- Higher order response (OpenRSP)
- Relativity
- Periodic boundary conditions
- Explicit magnetic fields
- Time propagation
- Orbital-Free DFT
